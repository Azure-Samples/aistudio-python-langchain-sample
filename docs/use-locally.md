## âœ… | Pre-Requisites

To work through this tutorial you will need:
1. Azure account with active subscription.
2. GitHub account with access to GitHub Codespaces.
3. (Optional) Set of docs that represent "your custom data".
4. Install [Python 3.10](https://www.python.org/) or higher.

The sample comes with a set of "product data" docs as default custom data. 

Make sure you have [access to the Azure AI Studio](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/faq#how-can-customers-access-azure-ai-studio--) in your region, and can access related resources in your subscription. Refer to the [Azure AI Studio FAQ](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/faq#how-can-customers-access-azure-ai-studio--) for more details on regional availability, pricing and more.

# Getting Started Locally

If you want to get started in your local environment, first install the packages:
```
git clone https://github.com/azure/aistudio-copilot-sample
cd aistudio-copilot-sample
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then install the Azure AI CLI, on Ubuntu:
```
curl -sL https://aka.ms/InstallAzureAICLIDeb | sudo bash
```

To install the CLI on Windows and MacOS, follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/Azure/azureai-insiders/blob/main/previews/aistudio/how-to/use_azureai_sdk.md#install-the-cli).

## Step 2: Create and connect to Azure Resources

Run ai init to create and/or connect to existing Azure resources:
```
ai init
```

- This will first prompt to you to login to Azure
- Then it will ask you to select or create resources, choose  **AI Project resource** and follow the prompts to create an Azure OpenAI resource, model deployments, and Azure AI  search resource
- This will generate a config.json file in the root of the repo, the SDK will use this when authenticating to Azure AI services.

Note: You can open your project in [AI Studio](https://aka.ms/AzureAIStudio) to view your projects configuration and components (generated indexes, evaluation runs, and endpoints)

## Step 3: Build an Azure Search index

Run the following CLI command to create an index that our code can use for data retrieval:
```
ai search index update --files "./data/3-product-info/*.md" --index-name "product-info"
```

Now, generate a .env file that will be used to configure the running code to use the resources we've created in the subsequent steps
```
ai dev new .env
```

## Step 4: Run the co-pilot with a sample question

To run a single question & answer through the sample co-pilot:
```bash
python src/run.py --question "which tent is the most waterproof?"
```

To run a sample implementation of LangChain, specify the `--implementation` flag with a `langchain`:

```bash
python src/run.py --implementation langchain --question "what is the waterproof rating of the tent I just ordered?"
```

## Step 5: Delete your Azure resources

To delete the Azure resources created in this tutorial, complete the following steps:

1. [Launch the Azure AI Studio](https://aka.ms/azureaistudio).  Verify that you are in logged in the studio.  If not, click on the **Sign In** button in the top right corner of the page.

2. Click on the **Manage** tab.

3. Under **Your resource** section, click on the **Azure Portal** link.  This will redirect you to the Azure Portal for your Azure AI Studio resource.

4. Click on your **resource group**.

5. Click on the **Delete resource group** button.

5. On the delete a resource group pane, type in the **delete** in the **Enter resource group name to confirm deletion** field.  Then click on the **Delete** button.

6. Wait for the resource group to be deleted.  This may take a few minutes.

### Follow the full tutorial

For a more detailed tutorial using this notebook, you can follow the [Build a co-pilot using the Azure AI SDK](https://github.com/Azure/azureai-insiders/blob/aistudio-preview/previews/aistudio/tutorials/copilot_with_sdk.md) tutorial.

### Customize the development container

You can pip install packages into your development environment but they will disappear if you rebuild your container and need to be reinstalled (re-build is not automatic). You may want this, so that you can easily reset back to a clean environment. Or, you may want to install some packages by default into the container so that you don't need to re-install packages after a rebuild.

To add packages into the default container, you can update the Dockerfile in `.devcontainer/Dockerfile`, and then rebuild the development container from the command palette by pressing `Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+P` and selecting the `Rebuild container` command.
