## âœ… | Pre-Requisites

To work through this tutorial you will need:
1. Azure account with active subscription.
2. GitHub account with access to GitHub Codespaces.
3. (Optional) Set of docs that represent "your custom data".
4. Install [Python 3.10](https://www.python.org/) or higher.

The sample comes with a set of "product data" docs as default custom data. 

Make sure you have [access to the Azure AI Studio](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/faq#how-can-customers-access-azure-ai-studio--) in your region, and can access related resources in your subscription. Refer to the [Azure AI Studio FAQ](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/faq#how-can-customers-access-azure-ai-studio--) for more details on regional availability, pricing and more.

# Getting Started using GitHub Codespaces

To get started quickly, you can use a pre-built development environment. **Click the button below** to open the repo in GitHub Codespaces, and then continue the readme!

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/Azure-Samples/aistudio-python-langchain-sample?quickstart=1)  

This will launch a Codespaces environment with all the dependencies installed.  Once the environment is ready, you can run the following commands to create the Azure resources and run the sample code.

**Note**: You can also access the codespaces by clicking on the green **Code** button in the top right of the repo.  Then selecting the "Codespaces" tab and clicking on the **Create codespace on main** button to launch the Codespaces environement.

## Set up your development environment

1. Login into your Azure subscription account:

```
az login --use-device-code
```

1. Create and connect to Azure Resources


2. Create and connect to Azure Resources


For best experience choose one of these preview regions for this exercise:
- Canada East
- North Central US
- Sweden
 
Run ai init to create and/or connect to existing Azure resources:
```
ai init
```

- This will will ask you to select or create resources, choose  **New AI Project**.

- Select your subscription from the pop-up window, then follow the prompts to create an Azure OpenAI resource, model deployments, and Azure AI  search resource


- This will generate a config.json file in the root of the repo, the SDK will use this when authenticating to Azure AI services.



Note: You can open your project in [AI Studio](https://aka.ms/AzureAIStudio) to view your projects configuration and components (generated indexes, evaluation runs, and endpoints)

## Step 3: Build an Azure Search index

Run the following CLI command to create an index that our code can use for data retrieval:
```
ai search index update --files "./data/3-product-info/*.md" --index-name "product-info"
```

Now, generate a .env file that will be used to configure the running code to use the resources we've created in the subsequent steps
```
ai dev new .env
```

## Step 4: Run the co-pilot with Jupiter notebook

To run a single question & answer through the sample co-pilot:

1. Open the `copilot_langchain.ipynb` notebook in the visual studio code (VS code) editor.

2. In VS code, click on **Select Kernel**. Then under Python Environments, select the **Python 3.10.13** environment you just created

3. Click on **Run All** to run the notebook.

4. Try asking another question about the products in the dataset. For example:
```
which tent is the most waterproof?
```

### Customize the development container

You can pip install packages into your development environment but they will disappear if you rebuild your container and need to be reinstalled (re-build is not automatic). You may want this, so that you can easily reset back to a clean environment. Or, you may want to install some packages by default into the container so that you don't need to re-install packages after a rebuild.

To add packages into the default container, you can update the Dockerfile in `.devcontainer/Dockerfile`, and then rebuild the development container from the command palette by pressing `Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+P` and selecting the `Rebuild container` command.
